# Assignment 4: API Testing Project with TestNG and RestAssured

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates API testing using *TestNG* and *RestAssured* to test a public API (JSONPlaceholder). The objective is to implement temporary solutions to validate basic API functionality and address technical debts. The code focuses on performing simple GET and POST API tests, isolating problematic code, and documenting improvements for future development.

The project emphasizes testing best practices, reducing technical debt, and using temporary solutions that can be improved over time.
